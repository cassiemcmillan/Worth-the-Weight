# Worth-the-Weight

Source code for nodematchhigh and nodematchlow terms included in nodematchhigh_nodematchlow.R, nodematchhigh_nodematchlow.c, and nodematchhigh_nodematchlow.h. Components of each file should be included in various source code files of the ergm pacakge. Additional details are included across the three files. 

For an introduction to working with the ergm source code, I recommend Hunter, David R., Steven M. Goodreau, and Mark S. Handcock. 2013. "ergm.userterms: A Template Package for Extending statnet." Journal of Statistical Software 52(2).

R code for empirical example presented in McMillan 2022 available in empiricalexample.R
